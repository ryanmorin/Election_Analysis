# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
Two members of the Colorado Board of Elections' election audit committee have asked for help to prepare a program that summarizes the county's election results and saves the results of the audit to a text file. The program will need to be able to provide the following information:

  * Total numer of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * Total number of votes each canadidate received
  * Percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote
  * The voter turnout for each county
  * The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  * The county with the highest turnout

## Summary
The winner in this election was the candidate who received the greatest share of the popular vote.  Not all elections are decided by the popular vote. Therefore to use this script for any election, additional logic would need to be included that determines the appropriate rules to choose the winner.

The output of the summary is in english. To use this script for any election the output would need to be tailored to the local language.
